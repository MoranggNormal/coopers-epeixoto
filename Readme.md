### Setup on your machine

If you are on Linux, all you have to do is to set the enviroment variables then open the terminal and type:

```shell
$ make dev
```

Now your app should be running on localhost

For other OS users, it may be not enough and you may have a bit more work. I can not give support at the moment.

If you want to run Docusaurus (API Documentation) locally, move to ./docs and type:

```shell
$ npm run install
$ npm run start
```
