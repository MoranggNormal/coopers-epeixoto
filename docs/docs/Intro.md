## Getting Started

This is a simple documentation for the To-do App API.

~~It is intended to work only for the server (NodeJs), and it should not be available publicly.~~

~~As I deployed this application in AWS, in the subdomain [coopers.epeixoto.dev](https://coopers.epeixoto.dev), you may not be able to call the routes directly (using postman, for example), as I used NextJs Route Handlers (**client**) to "hide" internal routes from the **server**, even though I used the same nomenclature.~~

~~So, if you intend to make some calls for the API, you must setup the enviroment on your own machine.~~

~~But I did not test it at all, some may work~~

I just tested and it actually works :D **but results are different from server, as they are parsed in Route Handlers**

**If you see any problem, please, contact me.**
